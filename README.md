# Pleiades

A multi-personality Discord bot framework built with TypeScript, discord.js and MongoDB.
Each bot runs as its own process and composes its features from a shared plugin
system, with English and Traditional Chinese replies throughout.

## Bots

Each bot is a composition root under [`src/bot/<bot>/`](src/bot/) that extends the
shared `BaseBot` and registers its own plugins and services.

| Bot           | Run                   | Required environment              | What the implementation wires                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ------------- | --------------------- | --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `nijika`      | `npm run nijika`      | `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `MONGO_URI` | Automatic replies, event mirroring, social-link previews, giveaways, activities, temporary roles and one-shot alarms, plus social-feed polling with its platform registry, an optional loopback [earthquake early-warning API](docs/configuration.md#early-warning-api) and CWA earthquake reports (optional `CWA_API_KEY`) |
| `tomori`      | `npm run tomori`      | `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `MONGO_URI` | Automatic replies, event mirroring, social-link previews, giveaways, activities and temporary roles, plus social-feed polling and optional earthquake early warnings/CWA reports; earthquake delivery starts off and is configured per server in `/settings`                                                                |
| `konata`      | `npm run konata`      | `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `MONGO_URI` | LLM chat for whitelisted users (a mention starts a session, a reply continues it), an online presence and an optional loopback [notification relay API](docs/configuration.md#notification-relay-api); the guild-join listener is off                                                                                       |
| `gopher`      | `npm run gopher`      | `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`              | Self-hosted LLM auto-replies and daily avatar/nickname sync; no database. [Endpoint changes](docs/configuration.md#gopher-llm-endpoint) take effect after a restart                                                                                                                                                         |
| `msg-archive` | `npm run msg-archive` | `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, `MONGO_URI` | The only [message archive](docs/message-archive.md) writer: live capture, periodic and full backups, and archive control; it exposes exactly `/archive`                                                                                                                                                                     |

Event mirroring posts message edits, deletions and role changes to a guild's event
channel and keeps deleted attachments through an attachment cache. LLM providers
and Nijika/Tomori's [earthquake feeds](docs/configuration.md#earthquake-alerts-and-reports)
need their own keys; see
[environment variables](docs/configuration.md#environment-variables).

Every bot shares the framework capabilities:

- Any registered slash command can be enabled per bot through its command list,
  except on msg-archive, which always exposes exactly `/archive`. A command that
  depends on a service the bot does not wire cannot run there; `/archive`, for
  example, needs msg-archive's archive control.
- [Thread moderation](docs/thread-moderation.md) is a per-bot option that requires
  MongoDB.
- Replies are localized in English or Traditional Chinese, selected per bot.

## Features

- **Tomori and Nijika server settings.** A private [`/settings` panel](docs/tomori-settings.md)
  with manager/role/everyone editing, form-based scope/destination controls,
  server language/time zone, individual entertainment switches/cooldowns,
  moderation-vote parameters, automatic replies and social previews. Tomori also has
  opt-in earthquake warnings/reports, a destination channel and an optional warning role. Changes
  use drafts, explicit saves and bounded configuration history.

- **Slash commands and components.** Commands, context menus, buttons, modals and
  select menus, with shared [state-based embed colors](docs/architecture.md#discord-presentation-colors).
- **LLM integration.** Chat through OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and xAI, with the
  user whitelist and settings managed through `/ai`, configurable
  [model and usage limits](docs/configuration.md#ai-models-and-usage-limits),
  and self-hosted auto-replies.
- **Moderation.** [Temporary moderation](docs/contributing/operations.md#temporary-moderation)
  through `/ban_user` votes with automatic reply suppression, and
  [thread moderation](docs/thread-moderation.md) with paginated ban lists,
  delegated management approved by DM and deletion of attributable bot replies.
- **Community tools.** Giveaways, activities, temporary notification roles,
  one-shot channel alarms, role-claim messages, level roles and restaurant picks. `/give_score` (also a
  message menu) and `/gay` give daily readings in the bot's configured time zone, with member and
  pair options and mention-safe replies. [`/gay`](docs/fun-readings.md) optionally uses archived
  activity and mutual interactions, with bounded queries and stored daily results.
  The message score menu links the original text, collapsing whitespace and truncating
  previews to 100 characters (including `…`, without splitting emoji). Markdown is
  escaped; messages without text use a localized message label.
- **Social media.** Rich previews for shared links and per-channel subscriptions to
  social feeds. X links and subscriptions use custom cards for text and photos,
  proxies for playable videos, and bounded video uploads as a fallback.
  Facebook uses custom cards with truncated text, complete image galleries,
  video uploads and engagement counts when available; the title links to the post,
  and failed video delivery falls back to a link. Threads also renders custom
  cards and video uploads from validated proxy metadata, without relying on
  Discord to expand a proxy URL. Uploaded videos use a single Components V2
  card with all post information above the video. nhentai and wnacg links in
  age-restricted channels open a paged reader with prefetched pages.
  Pixiv artwork previews are available with an operator-configured proxy list. See
  [preview configuration](docs/configuration.md#social-previews-and-feeds) for setup.
- **Message archive.** msg-archive captures messages, edits (up to 50 previous
  versions), deletions and complete reaction memberships. Administrators run a
  resumable [full backup](docs/message-archive.md#full-backup) after one
  confirmation, check status and set the
  [periodic schedule](docs/message-archive.md#periodic-schedule) (disabled by
  default) from the guild's debug channel.
- **Activity reports.** Any bot can enable the read-only
  [`/traffic` dashboards](docs/message-archive.md#activity-reports) on the archive:
  dashboard images in embeds (two for the activity reports), public unless requested
  otherwise.
- **Database inspection.** Nijika's admins browse any guild database read-only
  with [`/db`](docs/configuration.md#database-inspection): statistics, fields,
  filtered pages and single documents, with every option offered as a list.
- **Earthquake early warnings.** Nijika and Tomori's optional loopback
  [HTTP API](docs/configuration.md#early-warning-api) receives alerts from the
  地牛Wake Up! desktop app through a [Windows caller script](tools/earthquake-alert/windows/README.md)
  and posts one embed per quake, edited as the CWA updates it; the guild's role is
  pinged from a configurable local intensity (default 4). Tomori delivery requires
  per-server opt-in in `/settings`; CWA reports never mention anyone.
- **Notification relay.** Konata's optional loopback
  [HTTP API](docs/configuration.md#notification-relay-api) lets a local service,
  such as a deployment controller, post a progress embed and keep editing it.
- **Command logs.** Compact debug-channel embeds show the full command name,
  user and channel mentions, and execution time. See
  [configuration](docs/configuration.md#common-bot-settings).

## Requirements

- Linux x64 or arm64, an existing Node.js with built-in `fetch` for bootstrap,
  Conda / Miniforge, and `tar` with xz support.
  [`scripts/setup-env.sh`](scripts/setup-env.sh) downloads the Node.js version in
  [`.nvmrc`](.nvmrc) directly from the official site, verifies SHA-256, and installs
  npm 10.9.2 under `.runtime/`. Conda supplies only CJK and colour emoji fonts in
  `.conda-fonts/`. Setup installs locked npm dependencies and verifies actual font
  rendering; see [local setup](docs/contributing/local-setup.md#prerequisites).
- MongoDB for every bot except gopher. Integration tests use an in-memory server.
- A Discord application per bot, plus provider API keys for the features you enable.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ACaccel/pleiades-fleet.git
cd pleiades-fleet
CONDA_EXE="$HOME/miniforge3/bin/conda" bash scripts/setup-env.sh
export PATH="$(dirname "$(node scripts/runtime.mjs path)"):$PATH"
cp src/bot/nijika/config.example.json src/bot/nijika/config.json
```

Edit `config.json` with your Discord IDs and the commands to expose, removing
unused placeholder entries. Create `src/bot/nijika/.env` with `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`
and `MONGO_URI`. Keep both files out of version control. The
[configuration reference](docs/configuration.md) covers the other bots, every
environment variable and each feature's settings.

```bash
npm run register -t nijika --dry-run   # preview the commands
npm run register -t nijika             # register one bot
npm run nijika
```

`npm run register` without `-t` registers every bot that has both `config.json` and
`.env`. Global registration **prunes guild-scoped commands**; see
[registering slash commands](docs/contributing/local-setup.md#registering-slash-commands)
for test-guild registration and the opt-out flags. Registration is separate from
[deployment](docs/contributing/deployment.md), which runs the bots as systemd services.
For CI-gated automatic deployment of `dev` with isolated service accounts and
Konata progress notifications, see [local auto-deployment](docs/contributing/local-auto-deployment.md).

## Commands

A bot exposes only the command IDs listed in its `config.json` `commands`. Related
actions are grouped under one root. `/help` shows a private root-command overview
with a category selector, whose first entry returns to the overview; `/help command:<name>`
lists that command's paths and options. Admin-only paths are hidden from non-admins.

| Utilities and fun | `/help`, `/bug_report`, `/random_restaurant`, `/give_score`, `/gay`                                                   |
| Administration    | `/db stats`, `schema`, `list`, `get` (nijika only)                                                                    |
| Context menus     | Get avatar (from a member or a message author), get sticker, score a message                                          |

Upgrading from standalone commands such as `/feed_subscribe`, or from the removed
`/emoji_frequency`, `/sticker_frequency` and `/db_list_message`? See
[grouped slash commands](docs/upgrading.md#grouped-slash-commands) and
[message statistics commands](docs/upgrading.md#message-statistics-commands).
To add a command, follow [adding a slash command](docs/contributing/adding-a-command.md).

`/feed` follows X accounts, Bahamut boards (new topics) and threads (new floors),
and YouTube channel videos. `/feed subscribe`
requires `platform` and `target`, with an optional destination `channel`, then
opens a private filter editor. Nothing is stored until **Save**. `/feed list`
lists visible-channel subscriptions and offers a paginated filter editor.
See [feed configuration and examples](docs/configuration.md#feed-subscriptions).

Lower layers never import higher ones, and handlers and plugins do not import each
other; ESLint enforces the boundaries.

dependency injection, the request flow and message archive ownership.
