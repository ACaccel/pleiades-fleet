/**
 * Link-preview provider types and Strategy interface. Providers return
 * neutral data only; Discord message assembly belongs to the infra/discord
 * renderer and the consuming plugin.
 *
 * Three preview mechanisms, one discriminated union:
 *   - `rewritten-url`: reply with a proxy-domain URL and let Discord unfurl it,
 *     because a bot-authored embed cannot render playable video. Rewrite
 *     providers probe their proxy hosts with the Discord crawler UA first and
 *     return the first that yields media, so a dead proxy is never posted.
 *   - `card`: OpenGraph data rendered with `EmbedBuilder`, or a Components V2
 *     card with an uploaded video below the metadata (Facebook and Threads).
 *   - `post`: a structured post from a JSON API (X), used for a video post only
 *     when no proxy yields playable video, so the renderer uploads it.
 *   - `gallery`: a multi-page work (nhentai, wnacg) the consumer turns into
 *     a paged reader; see `./gallery/`.
 *
 * Adding a provider: implement {@link LinkPreviewProvider} (or reuse
 * `createRewriteProvider`) under `providers/`, append its name to
 * {@link LinkPreviewProviderName}, and register it in
 * `createDefaultLinkPreviewRegistry` with its proxy-host dependency, the
 * plugin config's `<source>ProxyHosts` key, and a recommended list in each
 * bot's `config.example.json` — proxy hosts are operator configuration.
 *
 * Error contract: a fetching provider's `build()` returns transport / HTTP /
 * parse failures as a {@link LinkPreviewError} and never throws, so an
 * unavailable upstream never breaks the user's message.
