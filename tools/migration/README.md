# Migrate databases and local files

Git clone supplies the application code. This tool moves **all application
MongoDB databases** and **gitignored files** such as `.env`, `config.json`,
`logs/`, `data/`, and tool backups. It excludes `node_modules`, build/coverage
output, `.plan`, `.conda`, `.runtime`, `.conda-fonts`, `.deploy`, `deployment.json`,
and migration settings/state. MongoDB `admin`, `config`, and
`local` internals are excluded; the shared application user is recreated.

## Configuration: source and split targets

Copy `config.example.json` to `config.json` beside this README:

| Field                 | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `environment`         | Official application Node.js prefix containing `bin/node` and `.pleiades-runtime.json`, or a legacy Conda environment. Defaults to `PLEIADES_NODE_PREFIX`, then `CONDA_PREFIX`. |
| `databaseEnvironment` | MongoDB runtime prefix containing `mongod`, `mongodump`, `mongorestore`, and `mongosh`. Defaults to `environment` for combined legacy environments.                             |
| `mongoEnv`            | Bot`.env` providing `MONGO_URI`, relative to the Git checkout. Defaults to `src/bot/tomori/.env`. No password belongs in this config.                                           |
| `backupDir`           | Parent directory for automatically named backups, outside the repository. Defaults to`pleiades-backups` beside the checkout.                                                    |

Paths are literal: use absolute paths for both environments and `backupDir`, not `~`.
Each `mongosh` call runs under a temporary profile with telemetry off, so it neither
reads nor writes the operator's `~/.mongodb`.
The application environment may be `<checkout>/.runtime/<versioned-runtime>` or
the legacy `<checkout>/.conda`; the database environment
must remain outside the checkout unless it is the same legacy combined environment.
An official application prefix requires an explicit `databaseEnvironment`; a fonts-only
Conda environment cannot provide MongoDB tools.
Binaries must exist in their configured prefix; no system/PATH fallback is used.
No target config is needed for an active combined environment. A split target
must pass `--config /absolute/target-config.json` on restore and verify.
Versions and all application database names are discovered during export.

A **backup** is one directory containing the database dump, ignored files,
checksums and a small recovery tool. The tool stores locks and completion records
inside Git's local metadata directory.

## 1. Export on the source

Run inside the current checkout. Preview the database names and included files:

```bash
bash tools/migration/migration.sh inspect
```

Stop bots, backup jobs and automatic restarts. Keep MongoDB running, then:

```bash
bash tools/migration/migration.sh export --writers-stopped
```

This creates a new directory under `backupDir` and prints its path and source
Git commit. It never stops processes for you. Keep every database/file writer
stopped until cutover. Tracked changes and untracked nonignored files are not
backed up: publish the desired application revision through Git separately.

Copy the printed directory over SSH (replace the path, account and port):

```bash
scp -P SSH_PORT -r /absolute/printed-backup-directory USER@HOST:~/pleiades-backup
```

Use a destination that does not already exist. The backup contains secrets;
keep it private. Partial exports have no valid manifest and cannot be restored.

## 2. Prepare the target and clone

The target needs Linux/glibc, Bash, coreutils, tar, and curl or wget (or a locally
copied installer). It does not need conda, Node, MongoDB, npm, or Git installed.
Bootstrap installs these and native build dependencies without sudo:

```bash
bash ~/pleiades-backup/tool/bootstrap.sh --env dc \
  --runtime ~/pleiades-backup/runtime.conf --apply
source ~/miniforge3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda activate dc
git clone YOUR_REPOSITORY_URL ~/pleiades-fleet
cd ~/pleiades-fleet
git checkout SOURCE_COMMIT_PRINTED_BY_EXPORT
```

Omit `--apply` to preview. The Miniforge release is pinned in
`bootstrap-runtime.conf`; its installer and SHA256 are fetched from that fixed
[official release](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases). Database,
Node, npm and mongosh versions come from the backup. No manual version list is
needed. Conda installs MongoDB, database tools, Python, fonts and native dependencies.
Node.js comes directly from the matching `nodejs.org` HTTPS release and is checked
against its `SHASUMS256.txt` before extraction. The private versioned installation
lives under `<environment>/.node-runtime`; `bin/node`, `bin/npm` and `bin/npx` link
to it. This avoids waiting for conda-forge to publish a security release.
Backups exported before the npm transition retain their bundled Yarn-based
recovery tool; use that bundled tool with the recorded source commit. Do not mix
its runtime inventory with a newer bootstrap. Use `--prefix /absolute/conda` if
conda belongs elsewhere; activate that installation afterward. Reusing an
environment created by this bootstrap can update its packages. Legacy environments
containing Conda-managed or manually installed Node.js are rejected before any
Conda change; select a fresh recovery environment and retain the old one for rollback.

## 3. Restore and run

Inside the clean clone, with `dc` active:

```bash
bash ~/pleiades-backup/tool/migration.sh restore ~/pleiades-backup
```

One command installs locked application dependencies, restores ignored files,
creates a dedicated local MongoDB, restores every application database and
verifies counts, views, indexes and file checksums. Existing runtime files or a
MongoDB data or configuration are never overwritten. A pre-created MongoDB
destination is accepted only when it contains exactly the configured `.conda`
database runtime and no other entries. The MongoDB directory defaults to
`mongodb-<checkout-name>` beside the checkout; override with `--mongo-dir PATH`.
The source MongoDB port must be available. Auth stays enabled, bound to localhost;
application credentials and `.env` contents are preserved.

MongoDB remains running; bots are not started. Update webhook/API routing if used.
No slash-command registration is needed. This recovery tool does not install
systemd services. For temporary operation with the current launcher, select the
official prefix containing the resolved `bin/node` as `PLEIADES_NODE_PREFIX`, set
`PLEIADES_CONDA_PREFIX="$CONDA_PREFIX"` and `PLEIADES_FONT_DIR="$CONDA_PREFIX/fonts"`
for bot commands, and verify the checkout's pinned Node/npm versions. Historical
source commits retain their own launcher contract. Otherwise complete the split
setup below before starting bots.
For persistent deployment, complete the split-runtime transition below and follow
the [operations guide](../../docs/contributing/operations.md). To recheck before bot startup:

```bash
bash ~/pleiades-backup/tool/migration.sh verify ~/pleiades-backup
```

## Split-runtime recovery

Export supports the split layout directly with the example configuration. Backup
`runtime.conf` records application and database versions independently; neither
runtime binaries nor machine-specific systemd deployment state are copied.

The portable bootstrap intentionally retains its combined-environment interface.
It can recover a split source using the same steps above: bootstrap a dedicated
dedicated recovery environment from the backup's exact version inventory, clone the source
commit, restore, then verify before starting bots. Both combined and split
export/restore paths are covered by the isolated MongoDB drill.

To transition the recovered host to the normal split layout:

1. Unset temporary runtime-prefix overrides, then run `npm run setup` to build the
   checkout's official `.runtime` Node.js prefix, `.conda-fonts`, and locked
   native dependencies. Keep the recovery environment available for rollback.
2. Run `bash scripts/setup-mongo.sh /absolute/mongodb-pleiades/.conda` to prepare
   the independent database runtime. Confirm its versions match `runtime.conf`;
   do not combine this transition with a database upgrade.
3. Update local migration configuration to the new application and database
   prefixes. Preserve the restored data path, MongoDB configuration, and credentials.
4. Follow the operations guide to prepare/review systemd deployment, stop the
   recovery server cleanly, and cut over once. Do not run two servers against
   the same `dbPath`. Validate readiness before enabling bots.

Alternatively, prepare both runtimes at the exported versions before restoring,
set `environment` and `databaseEnvironment` in an external target config, and
pass it to restore and verify. The database parent may already contain `.conda`
only; existing `data`, logs, or configuration cause restore to fail closed.

## Failure and rollback

A failed restore stops only the MongoDB it started and retains partial files.
Use a fresh clone/MongoDB destination to retry; do not remove data to bypass a
conflict. A killed process may leave a lock under `.git/pleiades-migration/`;
remove it only after confirming its processes have exited. Keep the source
until the target works. Rollback after target writes requires reconciling those
new writes first; never run both hosts with the same bot tokens.

Standalone local MongoDB with a shared `admin`-authenticated application
credential is supported. Replica sets, sharding, other administrative users,
and version upgrades are outside scope. Database verification compares counts
and metadata, not each document's content; complete writer shutdown is required.

## Tests

`npm run test:tools -- tools/migration` runs the unit tests. The isolated MongoDB
drill (`mongo.integration.test.ts`) exports and restores both runtime layouts
against a throwaway `mongod`; it is skipped unless `MIGRATION_TEST_BIN_DIR` names
a directory containing `mongod`, `mongodump` and `mongorestore`, with `mongosh`
on PATH. The `Migration drill` workflow (`.github/workflows/migration-drill.yml`)
provisions them with `scripts/setup-mongo.sh` and fails if the drill is skipped.
It runs when a file the drill depends on changes (its path list is in the
workflow), weekly, and on manual dispatch; it is not a required check. To run it locally:

```bash
CONDA_EXE="$(command -v conda)" bash scripts/setup-mongo.sh /tmp/pleiades-mongo
MIGRATION_TEST_BIN_DIR=/tmp/pleiades-mongo/bin PATH="$PATH:/tmp/pleiades-mongo/bin" \
  npm run test:tools -- tools/migration/mongo.integration.test.ts
```

`setup-mongo.sh` refuses to run while the checkout has deployment state under
`.deploy/`; use a separate clone in that case. Tests never use the production
database or bot credentials.
