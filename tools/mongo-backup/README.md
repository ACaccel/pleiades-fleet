# Daily MongoDB backup

A systemd timer dumps every application database once a day while the bots keep
running. Use the [migration runbook](../migration/README.md) instead for host
transfer: it stops writers, includes ignored runtime files and recreates users.

## Behavior

- Runs daily at 03:30 (plus up to 15 minutes random delay); `Persistent=true` catches
  up a run missed while the host was off.
- Lists every database except `admin`, `config` and `local`, then runs `mongodump --gzip`
  per database with the `MONGO_URI` of `mongodb.probeEnvFile` in `deployment.json`. The
  URI is passed through a temporary `0600` config file, never the command line.
- Writes `<dir>/mongodb-<UTC timestamp>/` (`0700`) containing `<database>/` dumps and
  `manifest.json` (databases and collections). A snapshot appears only after every listed
  collection has a dump file; failures leave earlier snapshots untouched.
- Keeps the newest 3 snapshots and deletes older ones after a successful run.
- Each collection is read at a slightly different time, so documents written during the
  run may be missing; collections are not a single point-in-time snapshot. MongoDB users
  and roles in `admin` are not included.

Defaults: `--dir /var/backups/pleiades`, `--keep 3`. The directory must be an absolute
path of letters, digits, `.`, `_`, `-` and `/`. One snapshot of the 2026-10 production
data was about 390 MB and took about 70 seconds.

## Install

For [isolated deployment](../../docs/contributing/local-auto-deployment.md), use
`npm run backup:install -- --release <installed-release-id>` after the offline
cutover. It installs a dedicated `pleiades-backup` service with its own private
`/etc/pleiades-backup/backup.env` and pins the root-owned script, dependencies and
Node runtime from that release. The helper preserves the pinned release during
retention. The MongoDB tool prefix is `/opt/pleiades-mongo/runtime`; bot settings
and raw database files are inaccessible to this account. Backup configuration
changes request administrator authentication and are outside automatic deployment.

The following instructions cover legacy deployments.

Run as the `deployment.json` user after the MongoDB service is deployed; system changes
prompt for sudo. Re-run to change options.

```bash
npm run backup:install                      # or: -- --dir /path --keep 7
sudo systemctl start pleiades-mongo-backup.service   # first snapshot now
```

Review the units without installing them:
`node scripts/runtime.mjs exec node tools/mongo-backup/install.mjs render /absolute/output`.

`npm run backup:uninstall` removes the units and keeps existing snapshots.

## Check

```bash
systemctl list-timers pleiades-mongo-backup.timer
journalctl -u pleiades-mongo-backup.service -n 20
ls /var/backups/pleiades
```

## Restore

1. Stop the bots that write the affected databases (`sudo systemctl stop pleiades@<bot>`).
2. Write a private credentials file, for example
   `install -m 600 /dev/null /tmp/restore.yml`, then add the line `uri: "<MONGO_URI>"`.
3. Restore one database, replacing its current collections:

   ```bash
   <mongodb.prefix>/bin/mongorestore --config /tmp/restore.yml --gzip --drop \
     --nsInclude '<database>.*' --dir /var/backups/pleiades/mongodb-<timestamp>
   ```

   Omit `--nsInclude` to restore every database in the snapshot.

4. Delete `/tmp/restore.yml` and start the bots again.
