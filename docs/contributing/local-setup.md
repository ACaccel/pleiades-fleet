# Local setup and development loop

Part of the [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Prerequisites

Use Linux x64 or arm64. Bootstrap needs an existing Node.js with built-in `fetch`
(Node.js 18 or later), Conda / Miniforge, and `tar` with xz support. The existing
Node only runs setup; normal commands select the exact official runtime pinned in
[`.nvmrc`](../../.nvmrc). Persistent bots also need a development MongoDB instance.
Integration tests use `mongodb-memory-server`, with its data on `/dev/shm` when
that tmpfs is writable (Linux) and in the default temporary directory otherwise.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ACaccel/pleiades-fleet.git
cd pleiades-fleet
CONDA_EXE="$HOME/miniforge3/bin/conda" bash scripts/setup-env.sh
export PATH="$(dirname "$(node scripts/runtime.mjs path)"):$PATH"
```

Setup downloads the official Node.js archive and `SHASUMS256.txt` over HTTPS from
`nodejs.org/dist`, verifies SHA-256 before extraction, installs npm 10.9.2, and
atomically publishes `.runtime/node-v<version>-linux-<x64|arm64>/`. It then runs
`npm ci` and verifies distinct CJK glyphs and a colour emoji through Canvas.
Existing versioned Node runtimes are reused after validation.

Conda installs only the font packages in [`environment.yml`](../../environment.yml)
into `.conda-fonts/`. Conda activation is unnecessary. Project npm scripts use
[`runtime.mjs`](../../scripts/runtime.mjs) to select the pinned Node and npm,
set child-process paths, and forward termination signals. Exporting the path above
also selects that npm for interactive commands; it does not change systemd services.

For custom paths, export an absolute `PLEIADES_CONDA_PREFIX` before setup to choose
a separate fonts-only environment. `PLEIADES_NODE_PREFIX` can select an existing
Node prefix when running commands; unset it before setup, which always installs
under `.runtime/`. `PLEIADES_FONT_DIR` selects an absolute font directory for the
application; the launcher defaults it to `<PLEIADES_CONDA_PREFIX>/fonts`.
See [configuration](../configuration.md#runtime-launcher-settings).
Vitest 3 uses the scoped Tinypool 2.1.2 override in `package.json` to include its
prototype-pollution fixes. Tinypool 2 requires Node 20 or later; the project uses
Node 22. Keep the override until the selected Vitest release depends on a patched
pool, and run the full coverage suite after changing it.

Canvas fonts come from conda-forge packages pinned in `environment.yml`; no font file
is committed to the repository. Both are OFL-1.1 and land in `.conda-fonts/fonts/`:

| Package                     | File used                           | Role                                                                                                                                                                       |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `font-ttf-noto-cjk` 2.004   | `NotoSansCJKtc-VF.ttf`              | Chart text. Required: setup and `ensureCanvasFont()` fail without it.                                                                                                      |
| `font-ttf-noto-emoji` 2.034 | `NotoColorEmoji.ttf` (9.5 MB, CBDT) | Colour Unicode emoji images ([`canvas-emoji.ts`](../../src/infra/graphics/canvas-emoji.ts)). Optional: without it, emoji images are `null` and charts draw text fallbacks. |

The emoji package (18.7 MB installed) also ships `NotoColorEmoji_WindowsCompatible.ttf`
and the monochrome `NotoEmoji-Regular.ttf`, which are not used. node-canvas bundles
cairo 1.16, which predates COLRv1 colour fonts, so keep a CBDT `NotoColorEmoji.ttf`
build when upgrading the package.

Use `npm run install-lock` to reinstall dependencies or `npm run setup` to update
the local environment. Setup refuses managed or unfinished deployments and refuses
to prune a legacy Conda environment containing `bin/node`. Leave the old `.conda/`
untouched until its releases have been retired; use a fresh fonts-only prefix.
The [auto-deployment controller](local-auto-deployment.md) builds in a separate
checkout and retains each release's runtime for rollback. Follow the
[deployment guide](deployment.md) for a manual runtime cutover.

The migration tools retain their separate, backup-owned runtime contract; this
application setup does not rewrite runtime versions stored in historical backups.

## Local Git hooks

Install once per clone; the installer refuses to overwrite custom hooks:

```bash
bash scripts/install-hooks.sh
```

Hooks check staged whitespace and [commit messages](branching-and-releases.md#commit-conventions).
Pushing a clean, checked-out commit to `dev` runs the
[quality gates](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#quality-gates); confirm GitHub CI afterward.

The push hook clears repository-local Git environment variables before running
gates so tests can create isolated repositories without changing this checkout.

## Dependency analysis

`npm run knip` uses Knip 6. Its configuration declares `systemd-analyze` and
`mkfifo` as host-provided test utilities, not npm dependencies. Keep the schema
major aligned with the installed tool; Knip 6 no longer supports the
`classMembers` rule. Helper types used only within their defining module stay
unexported; exported interfaces still expose their structural member types.

## Per-personality configuration

```bash
cp src/bot/nijika/config.example.json src/bot/nijika/config.json
```

Create `src/bot/nijika/.env` with `TOKEN`, `CLIENT_ID`, and required feature
credentials. Keep both files out of version control; see [configuration](../configuration.md).

CI copies each bot's configuration example before type checks and tests.
These copies contain placeholders only.

## Running a personality

```bash
npm run nijika # or konata / tomori / gopher / msg-archive
```

## Registering slash commands

Tomori and Nijika registration automatically includes [`/settings`](../tomori-settings.md)
even when the command list omits the entry. Use `npm run register -t <bot>`
after installing this feature; other personalities cannot expose the command.

Register separately from deployment. No `--` separator is needed (the older
`npm run register -- -t nijika` form still works):

```bash
npm run register                                  # every configured bot
npm run register -t nijika --dry-run
npm run register -t nijika --dev-guild <guild_id>
npm run register -t nijika
```

Without `-t`, every bot directory under `src/bot/` that has both `config.json` and
`.env` is registered in turn; bots missing either file are skipped with a warning.
One bot failing does not stop the others, but the command exits non-zero and the
per-bot summary at the end names the failures. `--dev-guild` needs `-t`.

`--dry-run` previews names and descriptions in `config.language` without Discord
writes. Use `--dev-guild` for testing; global changes may take an hour to propagate.
**Global registration prunes guild commands in every guild** to prevent stale overrides.
Use `--keep-guild-commands` to preserve them or `--cleanup-guild-commands` to remove
only guild registrations. Traversal is rate-limited; allow time on large bots.
