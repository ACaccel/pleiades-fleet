# Runtime and systemd deployment

For the dedicated-account deployment that automatically follows `dev`, use
[local automatic deployment](local-auto-deployment.md). The manual commands below
retain compatibility with existing deployments; an isolated configuration routes
bot preparation/deployment through the installed restricted helper. MongoDB and
backup migration require the linked offline cutover procedure.

## Runtime setup

Follow [local setup](local-setup.md#prerequisites). `PLEIADES_NODE_PREFIX` selects the official Node prefix and
`PLEIADES_CONDA_PREFIX` selects fonts instead of `.conda-fonts`. New releases copy
both into their immutable release directories; retain legacy `.conda` while old
units still reference it.

For a managed local database, create an independent runtime:

```bash
CONDA_EXE="$HOME/miniforge3/bin/conda" bash scripts/setup-mongo.sh "$HOME/mongodb-pleiades/.conda"
```

Setup does not start MongoDB or create/move data. Both setup scripts reject
managed deployed runtimes; retain the old environment until cutover is validated.

## Local configuration

Copy [deployment.example.json](../../deployment.example.json) to gitignored
`deployment.json`. Set `user` to the invoking ordinary OS user and `bots` to unique
personality names. Run as that user; system operations request sudo. Do not run as root.

Optional `runtimePrefix` overrides the official launcher prefix/project `.runtime`;
`readinessTimeoutSeconds` is 15–600 seconds (default 120). For managed MongoDB,
set its absolute `prefix`, an existing JSON-syntax `configFile`, and a private bot
`probeEnvFile` containing authenticated `MONGO_URI`. Omit `mongodb` for an external
database. Keep credentials out of deployment settings and command arguments.

The database must already be initialized. Preparation preserves its absolute
`storage.dbPath`, authentication, localhost binding, and logs, saving the original
config and generating a foreground copy for systemd. It does not provision data
or rotate credentials.

### Read-only inspection account

Nijika's [`/db`](../configuration.md#database-inspection) needs its own MongoDB
user with only `readAnyDatabase`; startup rejects an account with any write action.
Create it once as a database administrator, entering the password at the prompt:

```javascript
use admin
db.createUser({ user: 'inspector', pwd: passwordPrompt(), roles: [{ role: 'readAnyDatabase', db: 'admin' }] })
```

Put its URI in `src/bot/nijika/.env` as `MONGO_INSPECT_URI`, never in command
arguments or deployment settings, then restart nijika.

## Commands

```bash
npm run mongo:prepare  # Preview database unit
npm run deploy:prepare # Type-check, snapshot, and preview bot units
npm run mongo:deploy   # Install/start/enable database unit
npm run deploy         # Prepare and deploy selected bots
npm run deploy -t <bot> # Prepare and deploy one bot; others keep running
npm run undeploy       # Remove managed bot units
npm run mongo:undeploy # Remove database unit after bots are undeployed
npm run deploy:recover # Recover an interrupted transaction
npm run backup:install # Install the daily database backup timer
```

For code updates, run `npm run deploy` without undeploying. Register
[Discord commands](local-setup.md#registering-slash-commands) separately.

`-t <bot>` (also `deploy:prepare -t <bot>`) validates and snapshots that bot only, then
replaces and restarts its unit alone; it must be listed in `deployment.json`. Other bots
keep their units, so they keep running their previous release until the next full
`npm run deploy`, which also applies `deployment.json` changes such as `readinessTimeoutSeconds`
or the MongoDB settings to every unit. Inspect bots with:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pleiades@nijika.service
systemctl status pleiades@nijika.service
journalctl -u pleiades@nijika.service -f
```

The database unit is `mongodb-pleiades.service`. Its daily backup runs as
`pleiades-mongo-backup.service`, outside the deployment transaction; see the
[backup guide](../../tools/mongo-backup/README.md).

For gopher endpoint changes, follow
[manual configuration and restart](../configuration.md#gopher-llm-endpoint).
Deploy code changes with `npm run deploy` first; restarting alone keeps the
existing release's code.

## Prepared releases and readiness

Preparation validates configuration/runtime, types, Canvas and units, then snapshots
source/dependencies in `.deploy/releases/<id>` without starting services. Review units
and `manifest.json` before cutover. Configuration links, `data`, and `logs`
are shared. Private releases can contain configuration snapshots; retain any release
referenced by units or recovery journals, including after undeploy.

### Release retention

After `npm run deploy` or `npm run mongo:deploy` commits, the deployer prunes
`.deploy/releases/`. It keeps the newest 3 directories named `<timestamp>-<uuid>` (numeric
timestamp order; `RETAINED_RELEASES` in `scripts/deployment/retention.ts`) plus every
release named by `.deploy/current.json` or `.deploy/mongodb.json` (including older releases
still used by bots a `-t` deployment left untouched); referenced releases do
not count toward the 3. Other entries and symlinks are never touched, and symlinks inside
a removed release are unlinked without following them. Pruning is skipped when a recovery
journal exists or another process holds the lock, and never runs after failure, rollback,
`deploy:recover`, undeploy or prepare. A prune failure prints a warning and leaves the
deployment successful. Releases from
`deploy:prepare` that are never cut over age out like any other.

Each selected bot's local JSON settings are parsed before release copying or service
cutover. For msg-archive, preparation uses the same policy and runtime validators as
plugin startup, including concurrency and notification cadence; for konata, it checks
`notificationRoutes` with the relay's own schema, and for nijika/tomori, `earthquake_alert`
with the earthquake plugin's schema. Invalid settings
abort preparation with the affected field path; existing units keep running.

Readiness checks MongoDB and the active process after Discord, repositories and
plugins initialize; enabled archive history scans continue in the background. It verifies
startup only. Systemd restarts crashed processes.

For msg-archive, a full backup interrupted by the deployment continues on its own
after readiness with its original cutoff and checkpoints; a stopped one needs
**Resume** in [archive controls](../message-archive.md#discord-controls).

## Initial cutover

1. Verify a recoverable database backup; retain the old runtime/configuration.
2. Prepare both unit types, review paths/user/bots/database settings, and validate in isolation.
3. Stop old bots gracefully in a maintenance window; stop every database writer before MongoDB.
4. Confirm old MongoDB exited, deploy its unit, verify authenticated readiness, then deploy and check bots.
5. Check `systemctl is-enabled` and schedule a reboot test.

Unmanaged bot/MongoDB processes block deployment. First cutover failures may require
manually restarting old processes; automatic rollback covers managed services only.

## Recovery and removal

Only owned units are managed; unmanaged units, symlinks and drop-ins are rejected.
Failures restore prior units and enabled/active state. After interruption, run
`npm run deploy:recover` before retrying; preserve the journal and inspect logs if
rollback fails. Committed transactions are finalized without reverting.

Rollback restores code/dependencies/units, but not shared configuration, database
writes or external actions. New releases restore their copied runtime and fonts as part of rollback.
Legacy releases may still depend on an external Conda runtime; retain it until no
installed unit or recovery journal references it. Bot undeploy leaves MongoDB running; database undeploy preserves
data, settings, environments and releases. For host transfer, follow
[migration](../../tools/migration/README.md); exports exclude runtimes and deployment state.

## Message archive worker upgrades

Follow the [archive upgrade notes](../upgrading.md#message-archive-worker-and-tools)
and [ownership/recovery procedure](../message-archive.md#capacity-and-recovery).
Code deployment does not authorize starting a production full backup.

Configure the guild debug channel and register `/archive` with
`npm run register -t msg-archive`; msg-archive always registers exactly `/archive`. See
[archive control setup](../message-archive.md#discord-controls); existing installations
without saved schedule settings start with periodic scans disabled.
