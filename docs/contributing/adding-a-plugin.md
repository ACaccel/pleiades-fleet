# Adding a plugin

Part of the [contributing guide](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

Use plugins for bot-scoped jobs and listeners; interactions belong in `src/handlers/`.
Code a plugin shares with handlers lives in `src/application/`; see
[layers and boundaries](../architecture.md#layers-and-boundaries).
Render Discord embeds and Components V2 accents using the shared
[presentation color rules](../architecture.md#discord-presentation-colors).

1. Create `src/plugins/<name>/plugin.ts`: a private zod schema, inferred config
   type, and factory returning [`Plugin`](../../src/core/plugin/types.ts).
   Parse and capture config in the factory so invalid values fail at composition.
2. Set a unique `id` and `version`; implement the required hooks and subscriptions.
   Export the factory and config type through both plugin and
   [shared indexes](../../src/plugins/index.ts).
3. Register with `this.use(createXxxPlugin(config))` in the personality constructor.
   Add user-facing text to both locale catalogs; update config examples and docs.
4. Test pure logic, lifecycle/event wiring, failures, and cleanup under
   `test/unit/plugins/`. Run the [quality gates](../../CONTRIBUTING.md#quality-gates).

Lifecycle order is `init` → `start` → `onReady`; shutdown reverses registration
order. Startup failure disables the plugin; `onShutdown` must handle partial
initialization. Use `onGuildDatabaseReady` to rebuild jobs after database recovery.

Resolve dependencies in `init`; subscriptions attach after it succeeds.
Gate channel behavior with `PermissionRankPolicy` and add feature keys to
`RankedFeature` as needed. Do not add per-plugin `blockedChannels` lists.

## Plugin ↔ IoC contract

Use [`TOKENS`](../../src/bot/tokens.ts) with `ctx.resolve(token)` and publish
instances with `ctx.registerInstance(token, instance)` **only inside `init`**;
duplicate registrations fail. Add new tokens to that catalog.
ESLint forbids `@core/ioc` and every `src/bot` module except `tokens` and `guild-registry`.
Do not cast the context to access the container.

## Social preview media

Keep provider metadata retrieval separate from Discord rendering and delivery.
Pixiv reuses the validated rewrite strategy with normalized artwork paths.
Its optional proxy-host list must gate both registry loading and guild settings
capabilities so older configurations do not advertise an unavailable provider.
Facebook and Threads custom cards use existing OpenGraph retrieval rather than
discarding validated metadata and relying on Discord to expand a proxy URL.
Keep uploaded videos last in a single Components V2 card, after all post metadata;
classic embeds with attachments let Discord place the video above the embed.
Direct video attachments
share its host validation and bounded DNS resolver with address checks, download sizes,
deadlines and concurrency. Preserve the card and a clickable fallback link when
media cannot be delivered. Test download rejection and attachment-send failures
without live upstream requests. See [preview configuration](../configuration.md#social-previews-and-feeds)
for the supported metadata and operator limits.
